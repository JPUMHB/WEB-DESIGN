        <p> My academic journey has always been important to me, culminating in a 4.2 GPA upon graduating high school. 
          Growing up, I was deeply involved in sports, proudly participating in both football and basketball. 
          Though I have fond memories of my time on the field, once I got a little older my true athletic passion began to lie with basketball, a sport I continue to dedicate myself to.

            <p> Out of highschool I was thrilled to have committed to Regis University to play basketball, 
              marking an exciting step in my athletic journey. Simultaneously, my lifelong love for technology 
              has driven me to pursue a degree in computer science. This academic focus allows me to delve into a 
              field I find incredibly engaging. A particularly fond memory of mine is traveling to Greece, an experience that 
              instilled in me a deep appreciation for travel, a hobby I look forward to pursuing further in the years to come.

              <p> My athletic journey, particularly in basketball, has been a profound teacher, 
                introducing to me invaluable lessons in patience, perseverance, and resilience. Navigating injuries, 
                conflicting schedules, and even moments where others' intentions weren't aligned with my own, has 
                forged a deeper understanding of these qualities. Through these experiences, I've learned, and continue to learn, 
                the importance of having faith and trusting the process, both on and off the court.</p>
